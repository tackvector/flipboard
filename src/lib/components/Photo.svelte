    Sup, @oofdere! Just my thoughts:
        1.) Tell 'puter we want image by drawing a box when the photo tool is selected
        2.) 'Puter says "okay, which one?" Then, we pick
        3.) Image is imported but cropped to the size of the box drawn (maybe dumb idk)
        4.) Can be uncropped, resized, deleted, whatever else.
